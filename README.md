# job-test
Test repo for Field Javascript job test. Please **fork** this repo to add your responses.

You will notice that the files in this repo are using some ES6 flavoured JavaScript, but only parts of the ES6 specification that are already supported in Node.js (version 6.10+).

That means that you can test your code in the node console, for example, to run `callback.js` you can do:

```
node javascript/callbacks.js
```

which for now (until you finish it) will just print `Results: undefined` to the console.
